# Code_In_Place
This is a repository of codes from Code_In_Place_2021. Currently, it only contains my final project but I plan to gradually add more codes that I wrote during the course

The objective of the project is to graphically represent the gender ratios in 500 different cities spread across the country.
The document uses the following definition of gender ratio:
"Gender ratio is defined as the number of women per 1000 men."

The output of the program is an image which is constructed using the simpleimage library. To use the library, the simpleimage.py file should be downloaded along with the code.
The data for positional coordinates, and gender ratio is available in the cities_r2.csv which was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/zed9941/top-500-indian-cities.

Interpretation of output:

City indicated by red color in the image: There are less than 900 women per 1000 men in the city.

City indicated by blue color in the image: There are between 900-1000 women per 1000 men in the city.

City indicated by red color in the image: There are more than 1000 women per 1000 men in the city.
